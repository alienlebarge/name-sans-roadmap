# Name Sans Roadmap

This repo is a public roadmap for Name Sans, currently in-progress and available on [Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/arrowtype/name-sans). This repo’s primary purpose is to provide a central, public location for documenting issues and work currently being explored. This allows me to openly share my progress and helps my users let me know about any issues in a public place, without wondering whether others have already emailed me about it.

Do you have a question, feature request, or bug report for Name Sans? Awesome! Please file it in the [issues](https://github.com/arrowtype/name-sans-roadmap/issues). Of course, it you would really prefer to email me, you are welcome to – please find my contact info on my website, [ArrowType.com](https://arrowtype.com/).

*Note: Name Sans is ***not*** an open-source font. If you would like to try demo fonts or purchase a license for desktop & web usage, please check out Name Sans on Future Fonts.*

## Current Status

Name Sans is currently released in version `0.5`, with Weights 1–1000 and Optical Sizes 12–96. Future versions will add Italics and more.
